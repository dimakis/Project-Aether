# Commit Checkpoint

After each logical unit of work, self-check before proceeding.

## Rules

1. **After each TDD cycle** (test passes green): commit test + implementation immediately. No exceptions.
2. **After each logical unit**: spec files, doc updates, refactoring, config changes — each gets its own commit.
3. **Max ~400 uncommitted lines**: If approaching this limit, stop and commit what is complete.
4. **Proactive commits**: Committing is part of the task. Do NOT wait for the user to ask.
5. **Session end**: All uncommitted work must be committed or stashed before switching context.

## Commit Format

One logical change per commit. Use conventional commit messages:

```
<type>(scope): concise description
```

## Self-Check Prompt

Before starting the next task, ask yourself:
- Do I have uncommitted changes? If yes, commit them now.
- Is my last commit a complete, independently verifiable unit? If not, finish it first.
- Am I about to combine unrelated changes? If yes, split them.
